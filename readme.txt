Programming Assignment 3: Autocomplete


/* *****************************************************************************
 *  Describe how your firstIndexOf() method in BinarySearchDeluxe.java
 *  finds the first index of a key that is equal to the search key.
 **************************************************************************** */
First uses binary search to find the first matching index & then proceeds to iterate through all matching terms until one is found not to be matching or the end of the list is reached. I will come back and change this implementation as using another binary search to find the first matching term will be faster but for minimal gains.




/* *****************************************************************************
 *  Known bugs / limitations.
 **************************************************************************** */
still creating a full suite of test to account for edge cases but test pass so far.


/* *****************************************************************************
 *  Describe any serious problems you encountered.
 **************************************************************************** */

Problems faced included fully implementing binary search to account for edge cases
